# Chapter 1 Introduction

### Data Communication

<b>Telecommunication</b> It includes telephony, telegraphy and television, means communication at a distance.<br>
The word <b>data</b> refers to information presented whatever form agreed by the parties creating using the data.<br>
<b>Data Communications</b> are the exchange of data between two devices using a transmission medium such as a wire cable, for data communication to occur the communicating devices must be a part of the communication system made up of hardware and software programs. <br>

### Characterstics of Data Communications
<b>Delivery</b> The system must deliver the data to the correct destination, Data must be recived by the intended device or the user and only to the device or user.<br>
<b>Accuracy</b> The system must deliver data accurately without any modifications and errors.<br>
<b>Timeliness</b> The system must deliver data in a timely manner data deliverd late are useless.<br>
<b>Jitter</b> It refers to the variations of the packet arrival time basically constant, consistant arrival of time.<br>

### Components of Data Communications
To data communication to occur this system have 5 components
<b>Message</b> The information Data to be communicated.<br>
<b>Sender</b> The sender is the device that sends the data message<br>
<b>Reciever</b> The device which is intended to recieve the code.<br>
<b>Transmission Medium</b> It is the physical path by which message travels from sender to reciever.<br>
<b>Protocol</b> A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communication. It represents an agreement between the communicating devices. Without a protocol two devices are connected to each other but isn't communicating.

### Data Representation
Information is available in different forms Text, Image, Audio, Video, Animations etc.<br>
<b>Text</b> It is represented as a bit pattern a sequence of bits 0 or 1. Different sets of bit pattern have different designs to represent text symbols each set is called <b>code</b> and the process of representing symbols is called <i>coding.</i>The prevalent coding system used today is called <b>unicode.</b><br>
<b>ASCII</b> Americal Standard Code for Information Interchange.<br>
<b>Numbers</b> These are also represented as bit patterns but a code such as ASCII is not used to represent numbers.<br>
<b>Images</b> It is a collection of pixles arranged in a matrix form represents same like bit patterns. The size of the pixels depends upon the resolution of the pixels.<br>
<b>Audio</b> Audio refers to recording and broadcasting sound or music. It is a collection of sound waves recorded in bits and then arranged in different formats to acts like a storage of actual sound.<br>
<b>Video</b> It refers to the collection of Pictures and Audio here it is also known to be the collection of moving hundreds of pictures at different frame speed to act like a motion event on the screen.<br>

### Data Flow
Communication between devices can be <i>Simplex</i>, <i>Half-Duplex</i>, <i>Full-Duplex</i>.<br>
