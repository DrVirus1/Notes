# JAVA Tutorial Day1 10 July 2018

There are some new keywords in the java

## package
it is like a file structure in a computer it is like a root tree we use in android studio so package includes program name -> domain name -> project name example 
package com.akshaybengani.javatutorials.day1
It describes a high level desciption of the whole project.
It reflects the internal structure of the entire program use good names

## import
It is used to import other codes and other programs we include in the program
we can import any specific file or whole package example
import static org.akshay.MyAssets.*

## class
As we all know it is used to impose a structure to the code this is used to define code in sections and give them name as class examples. A class it is like a template. Every class have different works. It is a defination of what we created
class Car{
}
The name of the class in java should be a noun and start with a capital letter. A class should be focused on one topic keep your class clean and short.

## method
It is like function we use them in class called method. The name of the method should be clear and to the point they can operate on different type of works.
keep methods as short as you can from 3 lines to 20 lines.
The name of the method should be start with a small character and they should be short. exmaples. The methods should not have more then 5 parameters.
drive(speed){
}

## Variable 
It is used to store data 
Variable names should be start from a small character and can be upscale by adding small words in it.

## public
It is a access modifier In a class a method have a access modifier and we have a by default public access modifier.

## void
it is used to return a null value by a method example
public class Car{
	public void drive(Speed){
	}
}
In this drive is a command symbol and it is used to not return any values.

## @Test
we indicate that a given method will be used as a test.

## CamelCase
Since we use CamleCase technique to express variables and method names.

## Dot
A dot is used to indicate that we need to call the method inside a object example
car.drive();
so this method is used to access the drive method in the car object of its class. example
@Test
public void shouldDrive(){
car.drive(100);
}

## object
We create a object for every class we design this object is used to access the data inside the class and the methods of the class by using the dot operator in java to get access to it.

## object oriented language
JAVA is totally based on using classes and objects. The model is used to reduce the errors and problems in large code, A class and object terminolgy helps in differentiating code easily and find errors easily.

## constructor
It is used to construct objects of the class file. for example to access the object code in the another class we call the class by the object using new variable which constructs the onjects of the class.

## variable declaration
In java we have no limits on variable names.
example 
Car myAudi = new Car(1,320);
After this line we remember that myAudi is a object of the class Car.
