Now it is just we need to seyup the local user these are not credentials when we give historical records we say as commits.

$ git config --global user.name "Akshay Bengani"  
This is just a local name you can give any name it is not necessary to be official.

$ git config --global user.email "akshaybengani@gmail.com"  
It is also similar it is not checked at any stage that the email is correct or not.


$ git init project1  
Lets get started with Git basics to initialte a git project you need to create on e so enter your project name after the init argument. or just use "$ git init" in your existing project.

$ cd project1

$ git add file.txt  
It is to add the project file you want to share with your friends it is not neccessary to add all your files we can specify the file name after the add argument or if you want that all files in the project should be added just use the dot operator.

$ git commit -m "My first commit"  
This is a commit this will record the current time of the file being commited and record its changes that this is a history we recorded. In order to commit it is necessary to add a commit message because it act like a subject of the change therefore you have to pass an argument -m which stands for message and enter the subject/message you want describing about your commit.
