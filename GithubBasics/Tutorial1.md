# Lets Get Started with Github

Github whee people build software how people build software.

$ git commit -m "Commit message"

## Diff
This is used to check the changes done in the local system after last commit, I have used it sometimes for troubleshooting purposes.

$ git diff
This will return the difference of the lines of code between two files.
