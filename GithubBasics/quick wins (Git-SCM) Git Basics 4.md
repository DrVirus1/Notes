# Git wins or beneifts

1 Git is focused on the content, not files.  
http://www.progit.org/book/ch6-2.html  
It is not just like a traditional version control it records with high level precision. Git can actually measure the move of the source code from one file to another over a period of time. 

2 Open, not Locked  
http://www.progit.org/book/ch5-2.html  
Git's idea is to make a staging versions means that you ask the reason for the commit, it prevents you from commiting accidently means it ask for the reason about the commit.

3 Open, not locked  
http://www.progit.org/book/ch5-2.html  
The idea is to make people contribute towards the project. and then they have a control and review type of work and this works well in the phase of open souce projects.

4 Distributed, not centralized  
http://www.progit.org/book/ch5-1.html  
Now we will talk about the idea of being distributed, Git is extremely efficient with its network transfers, therefore it making it very siomple and pleasent to send large quantities of changes across the globe and even over slow bandwidth lines.

5 Conversations, not cutoffs  
http://www.help.github.com/send-pull-requests  
Git is offered at multiple web services like Github and many more you can carry on an binary info conversation about bringing a bit of code into a request for small improvements and tunings to make them acceptable to the overall codebase.

6 People, not tools  
http://www.oreil.ly/githubsocial  
when we focus on the people and not on the tools, the tools necome a lot less visible. some dont like that and in the case of git its fantastic if that happens.  
Making git use in writing good documents, Softwares or building some good user interface, not working with the version control system. 

7 Journal, not backup  
http://www.bit.ly/goodcommitmessages  
People use git in order of storing a snapshot of the changes at the end of the day, some sort of backup in case Local system drives are not working.
We should use git in order to present a journal of the changes of code rather then updating a big blob of code at the end of the day. when reviewing those changes the changes should relate with a extremely helpful for getting context of why changes were made, what changes are made and who made them.

8 Anywhere, not just online  
http://www.whygitisbetterthanx.com/#everything-is-local  
Git totally works offline with the system it means the changes you have made the files you have added and made some historical changes called commits are all happens in an offline mode. Its objective is to keep as many things local as possible and to occasionally have you exchange though some source of connectivity.
