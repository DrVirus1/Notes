I am looking forward to studying and understand <course name>. and this course I found worth to invest time. I am applying for aid as I need that I cant afford to pay in current time although I am very excited to complete this course.I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
