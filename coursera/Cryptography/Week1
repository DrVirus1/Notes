Cryptography is an art science of secret communication
It is from the human generations
secret communications different languages
There are some characters in cryptography 

Good Gyes
----------
Alice Sender
Bob Reciever

Bad Gyes
---------
Eve Evesdropeer
Malory malicious He can alter the messages also 

The model is like

PlainText
     |
     V		Encrypt
CybpherText
     |
     V		Decrypt

=============================================
		Lesson 1
=============================================
Confidentiality -> Cant read our messages
Integrity -> Cant chage the messages Example we get a SHA256 File with the download file which confirms that the message is not altered
Authenticity -> Cant forge the messages When bob recieves the messages it is not readeble by anyone.
So there are different algorithms are there to encrypt and decrpt the text

So to avoid messages to be readed by the eve we use an algorithm to do so this help us to maintain the integrity of the messages in transmission

Componets needed for the message Transmission
1 Sender
2 Messenger
3 Lanuage
4 Message
5 Reciever

		Lesson 2
============================================
Code and 
Code :- A code involves replacing concepts is the meaning behind the message not the form of message.
Word/phrase/concept replacement is called code

In Hindi :- The message we wants to convey is translated in such a way which is not meaningfull to anyone else who know the meaning basically like double meaning talks done in our home.

The problem with the code is it is very difficult to convey and generic 

Cipher :- In cipher we change the characters and symbols of the message which leads to transform the message.

Scytale :- It is a leather belt in which message is arranged in such a form that when it is folded on the correct wood N sides it is clear to understand.
	  ___
	 / _ \ 
	| (_) |
	 \___/ 
Like here we have 8 sides of the shape this rod is called scytale and the leather strip is folded on this and message can be decoded.
So anyone who have the same shape sized scytale only he or she can read the message.
But there is an issue with the scytale the attacker can decode the message just by using different shape scytale to find the correct answer. Here we say brute force attack comes here. 

Caeser :- In this we use different combinations of the wheel all are in a circular table when we shift them in a sequence it shows the cipher text everytime.

         _____
	/ ___ \ 	<--- Wheel 1
       / / _ \ \	  <-- Wheel 2
      | | (_) | | 	    <-- Wheel 3
       \ \___/ /
        \_____/
	 
Here we rotate all the wheels to find the correct combination.
Here we use an algorithm of decoding the cipher text written on the wheel we just need to find the 3 combination of the wheel to find the correct cipher text hence it is not so secured it is just a 1 layer more protection then a normal cipher text.
there are 26 possibles.

Cyptanalysis is the study of analysing information systems in order to study the hidden aspects of the systems.

Automated Cryptanalysis
Computational security
Mathematical Security
Enigma and project Venona

Enigma :- This machine was used by the germans in the world war 2 as per the movie Imitations game 
This is the commercial cipher machine in the modern years. 
However the mapping changes for each character

This machine makes the combination of 193,000,000,000,000,000,000
