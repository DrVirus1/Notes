#				Machine Learning
============================================================================

## Defination Arthur Samuel (1959)
Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Note:- He is playing checkers and he is not a good player of checkers and he wrote a checkers playing program he tend to realize that while inputting 10's of 1000 of diiferent approches to play a game and it eventually play checkers better then a normal human being.

## Defination Tom Mitchell (1998)
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves the experience E.

## Two types of learning algorithm
### 1 Supervised Learning 
It means the idea to teach the computer how to do something and
we gave the algorithm or we gave the data set which state what is the right price or what is the actual price of the house This basically act as a calculating averages using data set and plotting assumption points on graphs to find the results.

### 2 Unsupervised Learning
It means the computer will learn by itself


## Supervised Learning
### Regression
It means when we have a data set of large possible outcomes like I have a stock of 1000's of items and I want to calculate which stock is going to sell in the next 3 months then this is a regression problem where the amount of outcomes are very much
### Classification
It means when we have limited no of outcomes like there are 1000 employees in the company and I have to check weather there system is hacked or not so i take the outcomes as 0 for not hacked and 1 for hacked. so in this example we have a limited no of choice we can have multiple more then 2 choices but here we have 2 and this is a classified problem which can be easily solved.

### Example
so we take a example of breast cancer so there are two types of brest cancer tumor 1. Malignant Tumor and 2. benign tumor
malignant Tumor is harmfull and benign tumor is harmless
So in the 1st example we will plot Malignant and Tumor size where the size of tumor increases the chances of having malignant tumor more as per the graph in the screenshot weak1pod1.png
So now in the next example we have marked circle for the benign tumor and x as malignant tumor now we can say that increasing size of tumor increases the chances of getting malignant tumor as compared to benign tumor refer weak1pod2.png
Now we will use Age and tumor size as the data set so there are two variables of measuring the chances of tumors where the age and tumor size increases the chances of having malignant tumor are more as compared to less age and small tumor size.
so now we have a patient with age less then the average age of having malignant tumor so he keeps behind the line The pink dot represents the patient so it seems to be a benign tumor by our algorithm refer weak1pod3.png
