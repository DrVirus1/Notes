## Defination Arthur Samuel (1959)
Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Note:- He is playing checkers and he is not a good player of checkers and he wrote a checkers playing program he tend to realize that while inputting 10's of 1000 of diiferent approches to play a game and it eventually play checkers better then a normal human being.

## Defination Tom Mitchell (1998)
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves the experience E.

## Two types of learning algorithm
### 1 Supervised Learning 
It means the idea to teach the computer how to do something and
we gave the algorithm or we gave the data set which state what is the right price or what is the actual price of the house This basically act as a calculating averages using data set and plotting assumption points on graphs to find the results.
### 2 Unsupervised Learning
It means the computer will learn by itself
