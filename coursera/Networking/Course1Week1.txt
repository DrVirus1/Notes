Are u online ?
==============

You are called online when u are connected to a network then u r online 
What is a network It is a collection of devices connected in a same network each other

There are three types of devices in the market
1 End Devices
2 Intermidiate Devices
3 

The internet doesnt belong to anyone it is basically connections of different small networks like a small wifi home network connected to the internet.
So therefore the big parties of the internet are AT&T and other big companies who have connected in the network

Types of networks
1 Small home networks
2 The small office home network
3 Medium to large network
4 World wide networks

Transmitting data on the network
=================================

Data is the information u have input everytime u are sending data to someone on the internet 
There are very different types of data on the internet

Volunteered Data
================
This is we offere our self and we are agrreeing to share on the network

Infered Data
==============
The data we have generated by our activity Example Use of plastic cards these cards send information to the server on the use that where u have used  the card and when u have transact for even if u are in a shopping center shopping for something the card collect data about what u have buyed and hence it stores all the data about you.

Then data is used for processing analytical data

Observed Data
==============
Your phone probably shares ur location with the server and this information will be stored out in the cloud 

How Data is Stored ?
=====================
The data is stored in the bits and bytes all the information like images video text or anydata is somewhere stored in bits.
Text uses ASCII format

Getting Bits Moving
====================
After the data is transmitted into bits now its time to transmit data betweeen devices this is done in form of signals/ Radiowaves/ Light waves
There are 3 common way to transmit data between devices

1 Electrical Signals :-
  =====================
The data is transmitted over the internet using electrical pulses send to the copper wire.

2 Optical Signals :-
  ==================
The Data is transmitted by converting electrical signals into light pulses

3 Wireless Signals :-
  ===================
The Data is transmitted over the network using microwaves or radiowaves through the air.

ThroughPut
===========
It is the amount of data which sent or recieve over a connection including any delays that might occur in the network. This includes delays in both the directions.
In testing of throughput we download bits from the network

It is the actual speed transmitting over the network.

Bandwidth:-
===========
Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to transmit data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time.

Hosts :-
========
All the computers connected over the network that participate directly in network connunucation are classified as hosts.

Client :-
==========
these are those hosts that have software installed that enable them to request the display the information obtained from the server.

Server :-
=========
Servers are hosts that have software installed that enable them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other hosts on the network. 

Examples :- File Client and server, Web, Email etc.

Symbols of the networking devices
==================================
Intermediate devices :- Router Switch, Wireless Router, Wireless access point, Firewall, Service provider switch.

End Devices :-
Laptop printer smartphone ip phone

Network media :-
LAN Media or ethernet lan
WAN Media or ISP Communications
Wireless Media
Cloud represents internet.
