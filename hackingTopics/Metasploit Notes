Metasploit Minuate

SO What is Metasploit first
=============================

it is a exploitation framework it is a group of tools and exploits make together to form exploit development, system administration and porning stuff easier
founded by HC verv The vision of the metasploit is that earlier people have to find a particular exploit from different resourses and then they have to use with another tools to perform the task therefore HC Verv thought that we need a single platform where we can perform all the tasks easily from anywhere

Metasploit is in perl first time all generic places and shell code

exploit :- when u take a vulnerability and exploiting the vulnerability or taking the advantage of the vulnerability 

Vulnerability:- It is the weakness of the machine which can allow outsiders to create a problamatic situation for the machine basically like a loop whole which can be manipulated to enter in the device.

for ex:- In a website where u can change user id from 5000 to 1 and can become admin of the website, what we say it as manipulating with the php code in the url
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 

Use case for system Administation
==================================
we can protect those users who dont have deep knowledge in terms of cyber security or we can control the device remotely by using meterpreter.
We can kill process remotely in order to fix system freeze.

Metsploit comes in 4 editions 
=============================

Framework :- Here u get only msfconsole and the command line interface

Community :- Here u get the framework features as well as Community features where u have armitage and metasploit web framework

Express :- Here u get 2 + Automated Features and semi automated works 
means finding vulnerability and exploiting them automatically this version is paid

Pro :- Here u get 3 + Advanced exploits and more automated and advanced features used for organistaions for research and development

Metasploit course
======================================================================
Metasploit is a leading penetrtion testing framework by a hacker It is really really important to master it for become a hacker
It was developed by Rapid 7 it has different vulnerability scanners such as expose
Variants of metasploit 

Armitage it is a GUI version of metasploit framework
MSFCLI it is the linux command line interface which we also called as Metaploit Framework
MSFWEB it is a browser based version here we can set targets and exploit them using the web browser only.
====================================================
To start metasploit we need some requirements 
1. Postgresql for metasploit database
2. msfdb where we can create metasploit database
3. firewall permissions to open and configure firewall settings

Note :- to use metasploit faster we need to start postgresql to perform operations faster because it saves data in the database 

use command "service pk"
